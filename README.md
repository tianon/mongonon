# mongonon

## install
1. grab `MongoDB`, `JSON`, and `boolean` modules from CPAN
1. set up Apache to execute `.pl` files from the mongonon folder
1. hit `index.pl` in your browser

## configuration
see `%config` in `index.pl` (it is currently structured like that so that it can be moved into a separate file)
